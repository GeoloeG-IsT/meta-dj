## Security Policy

### Supported Versions
We develop on `main` and release iteratively. Security fixes are prioritized on the latest codebase.

### Reporting a Vulnerability
- Please email: security@example.com with details and a minimal reproduction if possible.
- Do not file public issues for security vulnerabilities.
- We will acknowledge receipt within 72 hours and provide a remediation timeline where feasible.

### Guidelines
- Never commit secrets. Use environment variables and `.env.example` placeholders.
- Prefer least-privilege credentials for local and CI usage.
