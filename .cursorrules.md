## Project Rules for AI Edits and Docs

- Prefer minimal, actionable docs; avoid long essays.
- Keep structure: `category[/sub-category]/tool-name/README.md` plus supporting files.
- Use headings with `##` and `###` (not `#`).
- Format file, directory, function, and class names with backticks.
- Use fenced code blocks only for code or config; avoid over-formatting.
- Never include secrets or tokens in examples. Use placeholders like `<API_KEY>`.
- When proposing code edits, keep changes tightly scoped and avoid unrelated reformatting.
- Add acceptance criteria and test/verification steps where relevant.
- Prefer links with descriptive anchor text; wrap bare URLs in backticks if needed.

### Authoring style
- Be concise. Start with a one-paragraph overview, then bullets.
- Favor ordered steps for procedures. Include prerequisites.
- Provide small, copyable snippets.

### Curation policy
- Capture both official docs and community best practices. Note the source when non-standard.
- Timestamp non-obvious guidance with “As of YYYY-MM-DD”.

### TODO List Management
- only perform one task at a time, enabling dialog with the user
- update the relevant repo docs accordingly
- then ask for confirmation to execute the next task
