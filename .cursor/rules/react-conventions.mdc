globs: ["**/*.tsx", "**/*.jsx"]

- Components must be pure and small; lift state when shared.
- Use hooks properly; obey rules of hooks; memoize expensive computations.
- Prefer composition over inheritance; avoid prop drilling via context where apt.
- Add tests for interactive logic and accessibility.
